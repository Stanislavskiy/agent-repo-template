# AGENT ENTRY POINT

> Read this file first. Load additional context only as needed per the routing table below.

## Local Overrides

Read AGENTS.local.md if it exists (gitignored — personal overrides, not shared)

## Project Identity

- name: [PROJECT_NAME]
- type: [web-app | api | monorepo | data-pipeline | library]
- language: [LANG@VERSION]
- framework: [FRAMEWORK@VERSION]
- infra: [cloud-provider] · [container/orchestration] · [db]

## Context Routing — load ONLY what your task needs

- multi-step task (feature | bug | refactor): check `routines/INDEX.md` for a matching workflow first
- new-feature: `context/principles/distilled/` + `context/principles/` + `context/architecture.md` + `context/domain.md`
- bug-fix: `context/principles/distilled/` + `context/architecture.md`
- refactor/tests/CI: `context/principles/distilled/`
- infra/devops: `context/architecture.md`
- data-model/db: `context/domain.md` + `context/architecture.md`
- architecture-decision: check `adr/INDEX.md` first, then create `adr/YYYYMMDD-[slug].md`
- deep-context: `docs/` (source of truth — do not edit unless explicitly asked)
- quick-question: this file only

## Always-on rules

These apply to every task without needing a trigger:

- **Minimal fix** — apply the smallest change that solves the problem; do not expand scope across layers unless each layer is genuinely load-bearing

## Project Notes

- Default branch: `[main | develop | master]`
- [Any repo-wide notes agents should know — size, monorepo layout, known footguns]
